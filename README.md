## About me

I'm an **Electromechanical, Mechanical Engineer** focused on Design Engineering. 
I got experience teaching advanced math for engineers that led me improve my Data Analysis/Data Science skills at work; forcing me to learn Linux, Python, SQL, a lit bit of C# and VBA.

This math and computer science approach motivated me to improve my programming skills and made me enroll into Harvard CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science course to start a solid journey into CS.


> **Main goal** is to learn enough of programming languages, networking and cybersecurity.
